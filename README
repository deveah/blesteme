	curses-like library intended for use in roguelikes
	--

	This tiny library is built in order to simplify the work one has to do when
	working with SDL and SDL_ttf. In other words, it's just a roguelike-
	specific wrapper. Due to the size of the library, it's intended to be
	statically-linked. So, if you'll need it in your project, you only need to
	mention 'blesteme.c' among the input files and link against SDL and SDL_ttf.

	There's an example included, so just
	$ ./make.sh
	to compile, and
	$ ./test
	to run the example.

	This project is public domain, and has no warranty. Use it at your own risk
	and feel free to contribute if you feel like it.
